			<p>There was no communication between Castor’s headquarters and the Gran Seco. The revolt had captured early the main wireless station in Olifa, which was on the railway near Alcorta Junction; and since the installation at the Courts of the Morning had been destroyed, the only station in the Gran Seco was under Lossberg’s control, and, so far as he was concerned, wholly useless. The telegraph and telephone lines followed the railway, and were now in a state of chaos. While Lossberg was cut off from his superiors, so were Peters and Escrick from their chief. They had their orders to worry the flanks of the enemy, and it would appear that they fulfilled them, for after the failure to break through the passes there was no activity for a week at the only outlet left to him, the railway to Santa Ana.</p>
			<p>For the revolt it was a week of desperate busyness. Sandy had his hostages, captured at the Vulpas source, and he made ample use of them. They were, except for Lariarty, Olifa regulars, and mainly foreigners, but among them were representatives of well-known Olifa families. The latter, after Luis had had a private word with them, were given a courteous dismissal and returned to their homes. But the rank and file were used for a different purpose.</p>
			<p>Throughout the country there were localities where the revolt was welcomed and the people were ready for its hazards. But in other districts the balance trembled. These were the richer parts, the great fruit-growing coastal regions, Alcorta, the environs of Cardanio, the corn and vine country towards Macheiro and Nimao and Jacinta. There both men and masters were prospering, and even those who favoured Luis preferred, if possible, to gamble on a certainty. It was to these districts that the prisoners went, in charge of Luis’s young caballeros. Their internment was ostentatious, their progress a dignified parade. To the staring inhabitants this spectacle was proof that the dreaded professional army, which they respected as a costly luxury, was not invincible. Rumour spread and magnified the story of the affair in the passes, for, since the inland telegraph was in Castor’s hands, rumour had no check. Lossberg, beaten in the Gran Seco, had made a desperate effort to break out, and had been utterly defeated. These prisoners were the advance-guard of a beaten army; the rest were shut in securely behind the bars of the Gran Seco hills.</p>
			<p>The effect was instantaneous. The sitters dropped off the fence, and areas which had been lukewarm became the most fervent of all. Presently the sporadic fires met and mingled. Luis’s small garrisons in districts which had been apathetic became speedily the nuclei of formidable risings. For a week there was no rest for the staff, for at last the concentration could begin. There were desperate problems of commissariat and transport to be solved, for most of the rolling stock of the railway was lying idle inside the defence lines of Olifa city. But every hour brought the armed levies of the south and east nearer to the city, and Castor’s <i xml:lang="fr">poste de commandement</i> was moved from Charcillo to Veiro, where Don Mario found the peaceful routine of his life changed to a succession of excitements which made him younger by twenty years.</p>
			<p>At the inception of the revolt Luis’s first step had been to get possession of the telegraph. The lines were not destroyed, but the points of their debouchment from the city area were held, so that Olifa could not communicate beyond her area. At first the Government had been able to reach Cardanio through the foreign cables, but with the capture of the naval base that avenue was closed. But it was possible to send news into the city, and by various devices the fullest and most startling information about the advance and concentration was at the disposal of the President and his Cabinet. There were other ways. Olifa depended a good deal on country produce, and market carts passed daily through its outposts. Agents of the revolt had thus a chance for circulating rumours, and Veiro by the same means was kept informed of most things that befell in the city.</p>
			<p>The reports varied. At the start the Government had been confident. The revolt was only a local and filibustering business, for there could be no fuel for any fire. The State was prosperous, taxation was not oppressive, for years there had been no conscription.⁠ ⁠… Then came a shade of anxiety, when it was discovered that Lossberg was silent. His last reports had been excellent, but he was singularly remiss in sending more. It was impossible to stir him up, for they had no wireless at their disposal, the long-distance telephone seemed to have broken down, and their sheaves of telegrams were unanswered.⁠ ⁠… Worse news followed. The Gran Seco railway had been cut by the rebels, there was trouble at Pecos, there was even a wild story that Lossberg had found an outlet in the eastern passes, but that his van had been cut to pieces and that bolt-hole stopped.⁠ ⁠… Then came still wilder tales, of risings in the south, of Alcorta and Cardanio gone over to the enemy, of a great rebel force moving upon the city. The hopes of the Government were still in Lossberg. He and his expert army must soon arrive to save the State. In his last report he had told them that the Gran Seco was conquered and the <i xml:lang="es">guerrilleros</i> driven to the mountains. He must be even now on his way down the railway, brushing aside the rebel screen. What if the line were cut and the road damaged! He had his skilled engineers, and his mechanised battalions, his cavalry and his tanks, his unbeatable infantry. As they looked from the Parliament House over the wide levels to the north they hourly expected to see the dust-cloud which would herald their deliverer.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>One evening there was a council of war at Veiro. It took place in Don Mario’s dining-room, where the big table had become a council-board and maps covered the ancestral Murillo. Sandy had come from the south, Blenkiron from Santa Ana, where he had left Melville in command, while Luis and Castor had returned from the concentration at Alcorta Junction, where they had received reports from the local leaders. Archie, who with Bobby Latimer was responsible for the air reconnaissance, had just arrived from a long flight north of Santa Ana. He had dire forebodings about the petrol supply.</p>
			<p>“There’s a lamentable lack of juice in this land,” he complained. “We’ve tapped all the supplies and are rationing jealously, but we’re well within sight of a shortage. There was a big fire at Cardanio which wasted a lot, and of course there’s none coming in at the ports just now. The Government seem to have skinned the country to provision Lossberg. I can’t think how Peters is getting on. He must be very near his last gallon, unless he has raided some of Lossberg’s stores, and even Lossberg can’t go on forever. It’s about time that we were bringing things to a head.”</p>
			<p>Luis was optimistic. “We are very near the end,” he said. “The people have risen at last. His Excellency will tell you what spirit we found today. Even the doubters are now convinced, and have become enthusiasts. Señor Sandy, your little affair in the passes has proved the conclusive argument. Now the Oliferos have no fear of Lossberg.”</p>
			<p>Sandy did not answer. For the past week he had been his old vigorous self, but now his vitality seemed to have ebbed again. He looked tired and preoccupied, and his eyes were always searching Castor’s face.</p>
			<p>It was the latter who spoke. “Luis is right,” he said. “Things are very near a head, but this is the real moment of crisis. We cannot take the city of Olifa by force. We have no siege artillery, and General Bianca has made the defences very strong. The defence, I need not remind you, is in a privileged position with modern weapons. The policy of the Government is simple. They have sufficient troops to police the city and defend their lines against anything we can bring. They are waiting for Lossberg, and if Lossberg comes we are beaten.”</p>
			<p>“I do not agree,” Luis interposed. “Lossberg cannot conquer a people in arms.”</p>
			<p>“I wonder,” Sandy spoke at last. “You have a great levy of stout fellows, gallant fellows, but not one in ten knows anything about the business. We are infernally short of machine guns, and we are not too well armed. There’s a variety of rifles in our ranks which would stock a museum, and our training is rudimentary. We are mostly third-line troops, and we have far too small a stiffening of first-line stuff. I don’t want to croak, but Lossberg could go through us like a knife through blotting-paper. Our only hope is that he won’t have the chance.”</p>
			<p>“Well, he is safely bottled up, isn’t he?”</p>
			<p>“For the present. But for how long? Peters and Escrick may keep him quiet for the moment, but he is bound to pull himself together and make for Santa Ana. And he is bound to succeed. Therefore⁠—” He paused.</p>
			<p>“Therefore?” Luis repeated.</p>
			<p>“We must bring things to a head⁠—now. The Government must surrender before he relieves them. How are we going to put on the screw? We are back at the old problem⁠—of cracking their morale.⁠ ⁠… It’s probably getting brittle. Bianca is a stiff old warrior, but the others are soft, sedentary fellows. They must be pretty jumpy by now. Is there anything fresh from Hamilton?”</p>
			<p>“We had a report this morning,” Castor answered. “Undoubtedly their Excellencies are nervous. Also their police. The lower classes are on our side, and there is a perpetual rounding-up of suspects, which makes bad feeling. I am a little anxious about the safety of our envoy.”</p>
			<p>“So am I,” said Sandy. “It was a wild escapade, and I don’t believe we should have allowed it. He’s too good a man to lose. How on earth did he get through the lines, and how on earth is he concealing himself?”</p>
			<p>Archie laughed. “I’m not worrying about that. He makes the best imitation you ever saw of a sulky drunken Olifero peasant, and he has picked up enough of the lingo to ask for what he wants and see that he gets it. Geordie is a very wise citizen. But I do worry about one thing. He has gone back to his old waterside and backstairs haunts, and what is to prevent him from being done in by one of the Bodyguard ruffians? They might recognise him, and for all we know some of them are in Olifa. More by token, has he seen Lariarty in the city?”</p>
			<p>“He doesn’t mention him.”</p>
			<p>“I would like to know where that sportsman has gone. You were too easy with him, Sandy. Lariarty is the kind of lad I would always keep under lock and key.”</p>
			<p>“May be. I don’t know.⁠ ⁠… But to get back to the main question⁠—how can we put the screw on their Excellencies? I’ve been away for a week. What is the exact position on the Santa Ana railway?”</p>
			<p>Blenkiron put his spectacles on his nose and spread out a map and certain papers. He expounded the strength in Santa Ana and the reserves at Pecos⁠—the exact destruction done to the railway⁠—the present position of his posts south of Gabones, and the results of Bobby Latimer’s air reconnaissance beyond that point. To the best of his belief, he said, Lossberg was being so extensively worried in the Gran Seco that he was not able yet to look southward. He admitted that the look would come, but he was positive that any advance would be a slow business. He drew a sketch of several parts of the route, which he said could be held for days by a small force against any army.</p>
			<p>“That’s good as far as it goes,” Sandy said. “We have probably a week at least in which to draw our people in upon Olifa and rattle the Government. A week⁠—but not more.”</p>
			<p>An orderly summoned Blenkiron to the telephone. “Darn those boys,” he grumbled, “they’re so mighty keen they always want to be passing the time of day. I’m going to call them down.”</p>
			<p>When he had gone, Luis spoke. He outlined the character of the various ministers from the President downwards. He was not complimentary, for he had the bitterness of the old regime towards the mushroom commercialism of Olifa, and especially towards the renegades of his own class. But he was not unfair. He admitted quality⁠—a coarse toughness of fibre⁠—the obstinacy of men who had been successful beyond their dreams⁠—above all shrewdness. “It is on this last trait,” he said, “that we must bank. They will be a little awed by the <span xml:lang="es-ES">Gobernador</span>, whom they have always looked upon as a wizard. They will be impressed by the rising of the country, for they know that it is a difficult business to govern the unwilling. We have arguments, perhaps, to convince them, always provided they do not get back Lossberg and his army in time. They are not soldiers and will be afraid of us, but, being civilians, they will also exaggerate the power of Lossberg’s professionals, and may be foolish enough to defy us.⁠ ⁠… A little while ago I spoke too confidently. We are still on the razor’s edge.”</p>
			<p>Blenkiron re-entered the room, and without a word made for the table where lay the papers from which he had given his exposition. He picked up his sketch of the section of the Gran Seco railway, where he had located various points A, B, C, and D. Then, almost violently, he swung Sandy round so that he could see it.</p>

			<p>“Lossberg has fooled me good and sure,” he said in a voice which he tried to keep level. “It was Melville talking. There’s been hell loose up the line. Our post at A was destroyed two hours ago.⁠ ⁠… Yes, cavalry and armoured cars and light field batteries.⁠ ⁠… There’s a howling desolation on the railway between A and B, but Melville reckons that B is going to fall before night. He proposes to make a great effort at C and is pushing everything up. But God knows what strength Lossberg is in, and, though it’s a darned bad fighting country, numbers are bound to tell. D isn’t much in the way of a reserve position. It’s my solemn opinion that, if C goes, in two days Lossberg will be in Santa Ana.”</p>
			<p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then Sandy observed casually, “I said we had a week. It appears we have only two days.” Every man in the room knew that tone in his voice. Sandy could be explosive and vehement when things went well, but in a crisis he often seemed to be a detached spectator from another planet.</p>
			<p>Castor’s face did not alter, except for a slight knitting of the brows. Blenkiron was on his feet. “I’d better get back to Santa Ana,” he said.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think so,” Sandy drawled, and looked at Castor. “I suggest, sir, that I go instead. I will take my Indians, every man of them. There’s going to be a pretty rough-and-tumble on the railway, and that suits me better than Blenkiron. I’ll push off at once, by car, and Rogerson can bring on the troops. I hope to be able to send you good news within forty-eight hours. If not⁠—well, the game’s with you. I shall be out of it.”</p>
			<p>“The game is with me,” said Castor. “I propose tomorrow to have a talk with the <i xml:lang="es">Excelentísimo</i> and his Cabinet.”</p>
			<p>“No, no,” Sandy exclaimed. “I beg your pardon, sir, but not you. You are too valuable. We must send ambassadors. You would be a hostage.”</p>
			<p>Castor allowed his head to sink on his breast.</p>
			<p>“I must go,” he said after a pause. “The responsibility is mine. We are playing for high stakes, and I should cast the dice.”</p>
			<p>“And be a loser from the start! You are our reserve, sir. You must stay here in Veiro, while your plenipotentiaries speak in your name. It is not a question of taking risks. We know you’re a glutton for them. It is a question of playing the right hand. Send Luis and Blenkiron. The one can speak for the republic of Olifa and the other can talk business. And meantime get your levies up to the edge of the Olifa lines. The Government have got to yield before Lossberg reaches Santa Ana. If he ever gets there, he must find that the whole country is in our hands. If we head him back, I’ll send you word, and that will be a clinching argument. But even if we’re scuppered, you may still win.⁠ ⁠… Let ’em know you’re coming. No, no! No flag of truce business. Get Archie to fly you to the Plaza de Toros. They’ll be hungry to see you. We’re gambling on the outer edge of sanity, and the wildest course is the safest. You must impress them⁠—it’s their nerves we’re gunning for. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, all of you. If I see Veiro again, we’ll be smoking the peace-pipe.”</p>
